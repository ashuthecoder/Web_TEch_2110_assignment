Ashutosh Gupta (47698144)- doing the task card implementation and styling related to the task card
I did the styling of the task card different than the one I had done for my previous assignment to avoid self-plagiarism
the delete and adding new task buttons have been incoperated in edit.js and task-card.js respectively rather than creating new files for each which could have been done.

Made use of blackbox AI as extension in visual stduio. It was really crucial in my understanding of the the code files that were already provided as a part of the base code. For the use of AI I even used to get new possible functions and keywords which really complimented my learning and understanding of different types of commands and attributes(basically learning new keywords and attributes ). The major turn of events were when how it explained me and taught me how the files are linked together and the proper working of all files as one. Even files like auth.js and login.js which we did not have to work on but browsing that on Generative AI gave a me a clearer picture.

there is not a lot of comments in the code 

Urvashi Chavda (47353104) - picked up Calender widget

I have implemented Calender widget which is fetching current date and due dates for the tasks listed. Most code are commented where required. I have added design adjustments for the overall widget card. I have used blackbox AI and chatgpt for the concepts and logic correction. I have used lecture videos for Lit component codes.

Leon 47448210: explosion widget
i made the explosion widget, i wasnt able to get the entire thing to cover the screen but i think i id a good job.
i used generative ai in:
-used to scan existing js files to find where data was being moved around, i think that this was justified as i felt that reading through hundreds of lines of code wouldve taken too long and that i was pretty much using ctrl + F on each file
-used to clean up my code, i used ai to help clean up useless parts of my code that appeared when moving my code from test.html to index.html, basically asked it to clean up and de clutter without changing anything.
-used to help understand lines of code that i had no clue what it mean, mainly in the js files that came with the project.
-used to help me with a few lines of code that wasnt working, when i started to implement my code into the main project i was unfamiliar with a lot of the functions and phrases that came from this project so ai helped me to convert a few lines so that they would work with the project. i think that this was justified as i had fallen behind from missing a couple weeks of uni and the ai worked helped me to catch up with my peers so that i wouldnt let them down on the project

Christian Yasmine (47888806) - Picked up the Timer Widget

Whilst working on the Timer Widget, I incorporated the use of flashing the timer value when it hits 00:00, Added an alert sound that plays when the timer reaches 00:00.
Introduced colour coding, and resizing of the widget buttons and text to fill the widget out and look simple and clear. Added start, reset and pause button to the timer.
I couldn't manage to make the page flash when the timer hit 00:00, and therefore let it flash as just the timer value.

Utilized AI to clean up my code, and assist in figuring out how to fix technical coding errors, removing useless code and helped identify functions and methods along with statements that I was unfamiliar with.
